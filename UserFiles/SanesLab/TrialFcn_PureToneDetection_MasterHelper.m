function NextTrialID = TrialFcn_PureToneDetection_MasterHelper(TRIALS)
% NextTrialID = TrialFcn_PureToneDetection_MasterHelper(TRIALS)
% 
% This is default function for selecting the next trial in the pure tone
% detection task. 
%   
% NextTrialID is the next schedule index, that is the row selected 
%             from the TRIALS.trials matrix
% 
% 
% Custom trial selection functions can be written to add more complex,
% dynamic programming to the behavior paradigm.  For example, a custom
% trial selection function can be used to create an adaptive threshold
% tracking paradigm to efficiently track audibility of tones across sound
% level.
% 
% The goal of any trial selection function is to return an integer pointing
% to a row in the TRIALS.trials matrix which is generated using the
% ep_ExperimentDesign GUI (or by some other method).
% 
% The function must have the same call syntax as this default function. 
%       ex:
%           function NextTrialID = MyCustomFunction(TRIALS)
% 
% TRIALS is a structure which has many subfields used during an experiment.
% Below are some important subfields:
% 
% TRIALS.TrialIndex  ... Keeps track of each completed trial
% TRIALS.trials      ... A cell matrix in which each column is a different
%                        parameter and each row is a unique set of
%                        parameters (called a "trial")
% TRIALS.readparams  ... Parameter tag names for reading values from a
%                        running TDT circuit. The position of the parameter
%                        tag name in this array is the same as the position
%                        of its corresponding parameters (column) in
%                        TRRIALS.trials.
% TRIALS.writeparams ... Parameter tag names writing values from a
%                        running TDT circuit. The position of the parameter
%                        tag name in this array is the same as the position
%                        of its corresponding parameters (column) in
%                        TRIALS.trials.
