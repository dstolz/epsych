1)  Requires Microsoft SDK 7.1 and Microsoft .NET 4.0 Framework (free)

Refer to: http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/en/data/1-FPLDGV/


If the mex file for the high accuracy timer (hat) is not compiled for some reason, it will need to be compiled using the following procedure.

In the Matlab command window:

> mex -setup
> y
> Microsoft Software Development Kit (SDK) 7.1 in ..... 10.0

change current directory to ...\ephys\hat
> mex hat.c


note: if this procedure doesn't work, uninstall other Microsoft C++ SDKs 
and reinstall the SDK 7.1








2)  To compile mym for 64-bit Windows for working with MySQL databases

Need:
> -zlib-1.2.7 ... http://zlib.net/
> 64 bit windows compiler ... http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279
> MySQL Community Server (does not need to be installed?)
> MySQL 64-bit ODBC connector
> redirect matlab current directory to location of mym.cpp ... ex: C:\MATLAB\work\ephys\db\mym
> select appropriate 64-bit compiler using 'mex -setup' command

*************************************************************************** 
  Warning: MEX-files generated using Microsoft Windows Software Development 
           Kit (SDK) require that Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 run-time  
           libraries be available on the computer they are run on. 
           If you plan to redistribute your MEX-files to other MATLAB 
           users, be sure that they have the run-time libraries.
